            text: 'Thesis description Common Criteria is an ISO/IEC standard for computer security certification. With a total of a 1080 pages this standard is very cumbersome to handle and the cost of certification is prohibitive for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Thus a lot of low-hanging fruits for improving the security of software products are available that cannot be reaped by SMEs due to lack of expertise and cost explosion. The goal of the proposed thesis is to design a simple set of tests and tools that can improve the security of a software product with low overhead. The tests and tools will be tested on a software product by our cooperation partner Q2D Solutions. RISE SICS will provide background information and the necessary guidance during the course of the thesis. '
